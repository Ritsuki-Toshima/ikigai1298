    <p>This is the webpage of a final Le Wagon Web Development school project named 'Ikigai'. It is an App designed to allow caregivers to keep track of their elderly relatives/charge's appointments and medications. It also allows for elderly users to keep track of their medication, appointments and to enter health records. There is no verification system for emails so you can sign in with a made up email address if you want to try the app. We have created the following test accounts for you to experience the app's features:</p>
    <p>For an elderly account, please use the following credentials:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>email: "displayelderly@test.com", password: "123456" (Only use this account to view features please <strong>do not edit or upload features to this account</strong></li>
      <li>email: "sandboxelderly@test.com", password: "123456" (Feel free to edit this account and try its features) </li>
